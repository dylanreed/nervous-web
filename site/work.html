                <h2>Google Gemini Discord Server</h2>
                <p>A pillar of the global technology industry wanted to create a unique, private community for the most engaged users of their new conversational AI experiment.</p>

            <h3>What is its purpose?</h3>
            <p>The community provides a constructive feedback source for their developer team, allowing them to interact with users on a more personal level to better assess consumer sentiment and needs surrounding the product. Free from the distraction of most social channels, community members are able to give more thoughtful, honest feedback, and connect with members of their development team in a smaller and more intimate setting.</p>

            <h3>What nervous delivered</h3>
            <p>nervous worked with their brand engagement team to create a private Discord server with gated enrollment and user verification systems. nervous served as a direct liaison between Discord and the client, helping the client understand server culture and how best to use the platform to accomplish their messaging and feedback gathering goals.</p>
            <p><strong>We exceeded all launch benchmarks, hitting the 6 month community growth goal in the first week.</strong></p>
            <p>nervous worked across a lot of different teams both internal and external, creating and implementing a replicable process for onboarding the client's various teams onto Discord.</p>

                <h2>David Choe's Munko</h2>
                <p>A contemporary artist, actor, and entrepreneur needed a dynamic online community with both public and private spaces that could adapt and evolve quickly as a mirror to the mercurial and impulsive nature of their paintings.</p>

            <h3>What is its purpose?</h3>
            <p>Client and their team wanted to create an evolving membership card token that reflected the changing nature of their art and granted the holder access to a unique, experiential community centered around their art, media appearances, and personal spiritual journey.</p>

            <h3>What nervous delivered</h3>
            <p>nervous set up a custom Discord server and crafted a "make them wait" strategy, launching with only one channel, no explanation, and a moderation team who became part of the overall storytelling.</p>
            <p>nervous staff monitored the users speculation in real time, feeding details to a writing team and suggesting story lines and interaction points, which they used to craft a full lore for the community that it didn't realize it was writing for itself.</p>
            <p><strong>As the speculation points started manifesting, the community felt deeply connected and involved in the project, forming bonds that far exceeded the normal artist/customer relationship.</strong></p>

            <p>Create a membership-based fan club and online community that allowed the band to connect with fans, offer fun exclusives, and deliver demo tracks, merch discounts, and other insider info.</p>

            <h3>What nervous delivered</h3>
            <p>nervous created a Discord server that served as the home base for the first official fan club for the 30-year old band. nervous handled all server architecture and ongoing moderation and community management.</p>
            <p>We then worked with the creator of the bands iconic mascot to develop a unique collection of membership tokens that featured imagery from their entire discography and history.</p>
            <p><strong>The tokens are used to verify custom roles on Discord, access private channels, as well as in-person verification at the band's merch table at shows to provide community members with special discounts and free gifts.</strong></p>
