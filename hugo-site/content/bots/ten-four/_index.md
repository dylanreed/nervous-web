problem:
  intro: "You've tried other ticketing bots. Web dashboards that require you to leave Discord just to change a setting. Reaction-based menus that feel like 2018. 15-minute setup processes that make you question if support tickets are even worth it."
  points:
    - "Support questions get lost in busy channels"
    - "No way to track who's handling which request"
    - "Team members duplicate work or miss requests entirely"
    - "No record of conversations for quality review or disputes"
    - "Users feel ignored when their questions get buried"
    - "No metrics on support quality or response times"

solution:
  intro: "Ten-Four brings professional ticketing workflows to Discord without the complexity of external tools."
  sections:
    - title: "One-Click Ticket Creation"
      text: "Users click a button in your support channel to create a private ticket. No commands to remember, no confusion. The bot creates a dedicated channel visible only to the user and your support team."
    - title: "Claim System"
      text: "When a support team member starts working on a ticket, they click \"Claim\" to mark it as theirs. Everyone knows who's handling what—no more duplicate responses or dropped requests."
    - title: "Multi-Category Routing"
      text: "Route different ticket types to different teams. Technical issues go to your dev team, billing questions go to support, general inquiries go to community managers. Each category gets its own button and support role."
    - title: "Automatic Transcripts"
      text: "When a ticket closes, Ten-Four automatically generates a complete transcript with timestamps, authors, attachments, and embeds. Transcripts are saved to your log channel for audit trails and quality review."
    - title: "Inactivity Reminders"
      text: "Configure how long tickets can sit idle before the bot sends a reminder. Your support team gets pinged, and the user is asked if they still need help. Nothing falls through the cracks."
    - title: "Satisfaction Ratings"
      text: "Optionally prompt users to rate their support experience when closing tickets. Track support quality over time and identify areas for improvement."
