problem:
  intro: "Traditional Discord analytics leave you guessing:"
  points:
    - "Dashboards full of numbers but no clear actions to take"
    - "No way to measure quality of engagement, just quantity"

    - "No visibility into sentiment or what topics are resonating"

solution:
  intro: "Anxious Analytics keeps things quick and simple, so your team can spend time actually engaging instead of sifting through data."

    - title: "Insights Delivered to Your Inbox"
      text: "No more logging into dashboards. <strong>Weekly reports</strong> arrive Monday morning covering the previous week. <strong>Monthly summaries</strong> land on the first of each month. All the information your team needs, delivered where they already work."
    - title: "Two Reports, Two Audiences"
      text: "<strong>Executive reports</strong> provide high-level overviews—this is UP, this is DOWN, here's what matters. <strong>Team reports</strong> go deeper with granular detail, strategy recommendations, and specific action items. Everyone gets the level of detail they need."
    - title: "Quality Over Quantity"
      text: "The <strong>Quality Measure</strong> grades your community's engagement depth—not just message counts, but whether conversations are meaningful. <strong>Community Pulse</strong> highlights 2-3 notable topics from the week so you know what your members actually care about."

faq:
