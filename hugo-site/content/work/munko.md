## What is its purpose?

Client and their team wanted to create an evolving membership card token that reflected the changing nature of their art and granted the holder access to a unique, experiential community centered around their art, media appearances, and personal spiritual journey.

## What nervous delivered

nervous set up a custom Discord server and crafted a "make them wait" strategy, launching with only one channel, no explanation, and a moderation team who became part of the overall storytelling.

nervous staff monitored the users speculation in real time, feeding details to a writing team and suggesting story lines and interaction points, which they used to craft a full lore for the community that it didn't realize it was writing for itself.

**As the speculation points started manifesting, the community felt deeply connected and involved in the project, forming bonds that far exceeded the normal artist/customer relationship.**
