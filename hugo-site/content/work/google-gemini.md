## What is its purpose?

The community provides a constructive feedback source for their developer team, allowing them to interact with users on a more personal level to better assess consumer sentiment and needs surrounding the product. Free from the distraction of most social channels, community members are able to give more thoughtful, honest feedback, and connect with members of their development team in a smaller and more intimate setting.

## What nervous delivered

nervous worked with their brand engagement team to create a private Discord server with gated enrollment and user verification systems. nervous served as a direct liaison between Discord and the client, helping the client understand server culture and how best to use the platform to accomplish their messaging and feedback gathering goals.

**We exceeded all launch benchmarks, hitting the 6 month community growth goal in the first week.**

nervous worked across a lot of different teams both internal and external, creating and implementing a replicable process for onboarding the client's various teams onto Discord.
