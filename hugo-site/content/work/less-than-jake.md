## What is its purpose?

Create a membership-based fan club and online community that allowed the band to connect with fans, offer fun exclusives, and deliver demo tracks, merch discounts, and other insider info.

## What nervous delivered

nervous created a Discord server that served as the home base for the first official fan club for the 30-year old band. nervous handled all server architecture and ongoing moderation and community management.

We then worked with the creator of the bands iconic mascot to develop a unique collection of membership tokens that featured imagery from their entire discography and history.

**The tokens are used to verify custom roles on Discord, access private channels, as well as in-person verification at the band's merch table at shows to provide community members with special discounts and free gifts.**
