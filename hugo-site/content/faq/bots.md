weight: 2
questions:
  - q: "How do I get started with a bot?"
    a: "Schedule a call with us through our <a href=\"https://calendly.com/nervous/intro\">contact page</a>. We'll discuss your needs, set up the bot for your server, and walk you through configuration."
  - q: "Can I use multiple bots together?"
    a: "Absolutely! Our bots are designed to work together. Many communities use Bouncer Bot for moderation alongside Merch Table for commerce, or combine Roadie for events with Plus One for controlled growth."
  - q: "Do you offer custom bot development?"
    a: "Yes! If you have specific needs that our existing bots don't cover, we can build custom solutions. <a href=\"https://calendly.com/nervous/intro\">Get in touch</a> to discuss your requirements."
  - q: "What kind of support do you provide?"
    a: "All our bots come with setup assistance, documentation, and ongoing support. We're here to help you get the most out of your community tools."
  - q: "What is Ten-Four Ticketing?"
    a: "Ten-Four is our professional ticketing bot for Discord. It creates private support channels when users need help, lets staff claim and manage tickets, and automatically generates transcripts when tickets close. Perfect for communities that need organized support workflows."
  - q: "How does Ten-Four's ticket system work?"
    a: "Users click a button in your designated panel channel to create a private ticket. Only the user and your support team can see it. Staff can claim tickets, add team members, and close them when resolved. The bot tracks activity and generates complete transcripts for your records."
  - q: "Can Ten-Four route tickets to different teams?"
    a: "Yes! Ten-Four supports multiple ticket categories, each with its own support role. You can set up categories like 'Technical Support', 'Billing', or 'General Questions' and route them to the right team automatically."
  - q: "What happens to tickets when they're closed?"
    a: "When a ticket closes, Ten-Four fetches the complete message history (up to 500 messages), formats it as a readable transcript with timestamps and attachments, posts it to your log channel, and then deletes the ticket channel. You get a permanent record without channel clutter."
