questions:
  - q: "How does the QR code onboarding work?"
    a: "Display the QR code at your event—on screens, posters, badges, or handouts. When attendees scan it, they're taken directly to join your Discord server with no typing required."
  - q: "What roles can be automatically assigned?"
    a: "Any role you want! Common examples include event-specific roles (\"Summer Tour 2025\"), status roles (\"VIP\", \"Early Supporter\"), or access roles that unlock exclusive channels."
  - q: "Do we need to train event staff?"
    a: "No. roadie is fully automated. Your staff just needs to display the QR code—the bot handles all user onboarding and role assignment automatically."
  - q: "Can we use different QR codes for different events?"
    a: "Yes! Each event can have its own QR code with its own automatic role assignment. This lets you track exactly who attended which events."
