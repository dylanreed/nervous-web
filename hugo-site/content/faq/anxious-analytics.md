  - q: "Is my community data stored?"
    a: "anxious analytics uses on-demand data processing rather than persistent storage, making it GDPR-compliant. We're also working toward private LLM infrastructure to eliminate third-party data sharing entirely."
  - q: "How large of a server can it handle?"
    a: "anxious analytics handles real-time tracking across servers with 400K+ members. It's built for scale."
  - q: "What's the Wilson Confidence Index?"
