weight: 8
questions:
  - q: "What is 10-4 ticketing?"
    a: "10-4 is our professional ticketing bot for Discord. It creates private support channels when users need help, lets staff claim and manage tickets, and automatically generates transcripts when tickets close. Perfect for communities that need organized support workflows."
  - q: "How does 10-4's ticket system work?"
    a: "Users click a button in your designated panel channel to create a private ticket. Only the user and your support team can see it. Staff can claim tickets, add team members, and close them when resolved. The bot tracks activity and generates complete transcripts for your records."
  - q: "Can 10-4 route tickets to different teams?"
    a: "Yes! 10-4 supports multiple ticket categories, each with its own support role. You can set up categories like 'Technical Support', 'Billing', or 'General Questions' and route them to the right team automatically."
  - q: "What happens to tickets when they're closed?"
    a: "When a ticket closes, 10-4 fetches the complete message history (up to 500 messages), formats it as a readable transcript with timestamps and attachments, posts it to your log channel, and then deletes the ticket channel. You get a permanent record without channel clutter."
