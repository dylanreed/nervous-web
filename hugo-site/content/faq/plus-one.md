questions:
  - q: "How do invite quotas work?"
    a: "Each member gets a set number of invites they can create. You choose the quota mode: fixed (everyone gets X invites), tiered (based on roles), earned (based on activity), or replenishing (quotas reset over time)."
  - q: "What are trial invites?"
    a: "Trial invites give new members temporary access with an auto-expiring role. After the trial period, they either need to be approved for full membership or they lose access automatically."
  - q: "Can I see who invited whom?"
    a: "Yes! +1 tracks every invite with full audit logs. You can see which member created each invite and who joined through it."
  - q: "What happens if someone abuses their invite privileges?"
    a: "You can revoke individual members' invite privileges, adjust their quota, or see exactly who they've invited to take appropriate action."
