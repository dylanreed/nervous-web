                        <p>Bundle prices are calculated from each bot's Starter tier, then the bundle discount is applied. You can upgrade individual bots to Pro or Enterprise tiers for additional features—the bundle discount still applies to the base price.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! Each bot in your bundle can be on a different tier. For example, you might want Bouncer on Enterprise for bulk operations, but keep 10-4 on Starter. The bundle discount applies to whatever combination you choose.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely. You can add bots to your bundle at any time and your discount will automatically upgrade if you cross into a new tier. If you remove a bot, your discount adjusts accordingly.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
