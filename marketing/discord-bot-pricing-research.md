### Feature Comparison: Merch Table vs Competitors

| Feature | Merch Table | Discord Gate | Discord Connect | miniOrange | Guild Bots |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Role-based product visibility** | ✓ | Discounts only | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Checkout validation** | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Role → customer tag sync | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Purchase → role assignment | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (Premium) | ✓ (Premium) | ✓ |

| Order notifications | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Admin dashboard | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Native Shopify app | ? | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### Merch Table's Unique Position

| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **True product hiding** | Others offer discounts; Merch Table hides products entirely from non-eligible users |
| **Checkout validation** | Prevents bypass via direct links - competitors don't validate at purchase |
| **Role→Shopify direction** | Most competitors go Purchase→Role; Merch Table does Role→Access |
| **Real-time sync** | Instant tag updates when Discord roles change |
| **Minimal data storage** | Privacy-focused approach |

### Gap Analysis: What Competitors Offer

| Feature Merch Table May Lack | Who Offers It |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| Purchase → Discord role assignment | Discord Connect, miniOrange, Guild Bots |
| Discord SSO for store login | miniOrange, Discord Connect |
| Order/stock notifications to Discord | miniOrange, Guild Bots |
| Native Shopify App Store listing | All competitors |
| Tiered spending rewards | Guild Bots |

### Merch Table Pricing Recommendation

The market shows two pricing models:
1. **Login/order-limited tiers**: $19-$89/mo based on volume
2. **Feature-gated tiers**: $19-$79/mo unlocking capabilities

Given Merch Table's unique **product visibility + checkout validation** combination:

| Suggested Tier | Price | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Starter | $19-29/mo | Compete with Discord Connect/Guild Bots basic |
| Pro | $49-79/mo | Match miniOrange/Discord Connect premium |
| Enterprise | $99-149/mo | Below Discord Gate's $199 but above mid-market |

The checkout validation feature alone justifies premium pricing - no competitor prevents direct-link bypass.

| **Invite revocation** | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Audit/accountability logs** | ✓ | Limited | Limited | Limited | ✗ |

### Competitive Landscape Analysis

**What Competitors Focus On:**
- **Invite Tracker / InviteLogger / Invi Bot**: Tracking who invited whom, leaderboards, rewards for top inviters, gamification
- **Trial Bot**: Temporary role assignment with time limits
- **Referral Ranks**: Role rewards based on invite counts

**What Plus One Uniquely Offers:**
1. **Controlled invite generation** - Members generate invites, not admins copying links
2. **Quota management** - Limit how many invites each member can create
3. **Single-use enforcement** - Each link works once, preventing sharing
4. **Tiered quota modes** - Fixed, role-based, replenishing, or earned
5. **Trial access system** - Temporary roles with automatic expiration
6. **Invite revocation** - Cancel unused invites
7. **Full accountability** - Track creation, usage, and expiration

### Plus One's Unique Position

| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Invite quotas** | No competitor limits how many invites a member can create |
| **Single-use by design** | Others track invites; Plus One creates controlled single-use links |
| **Multiple quota modes** | Fixed, tiered, replenishing, earned - flexible for any community model |
| **Trial + invite combo** | Only bot combining controlled invites with trial membership |
| **Member-initiated invites** | Members generate links via command, not admin distribution |
| **Native Discord invites** | Uses real Discord invite links, not custom codes |

### Gap Analysis: What Competitors Offer

| Feature Plus One May Lack | Who Offers It |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Invite leaderboards | Invite Tracker, InviteLogger, Invi Bot |
| Customizable join/leave messages | All major competitors |
| Fake invite detection | Invite Tracker, InviteLogger, Invi Bot |
| Verification system | Invite Tracker, Invi Bot |
| Giveaways integration | Invite Tracker |
| Web dashboard | Invite Tracker, Invi Bot |
| Invite rewards/gamification | Invite Tracker, Referral Ranks |

### Use Case Differentiation

**Plus One is for:**
- Private/exclusive communities controlling growth
- Servers where members "vouch" for new members
- Trial/freemium communities with time-limited access
- Communities needing accountability (who let whom in)
- Invite-only servers without admin bottleneck

**Competitors are for:**
- Public servers tracking organic growth
- Gamified communities rewarding top recruiters
- Servers wanting invite leaderboards and competition
- Communities using invites as engagement metric

### Plus One Pricing Recommendation

The market shows:
- **Basic tracking bots**: $2-$6/month
- **Advanced/custom bots**: $15-$25/month
- **Trial-focused bots**: $5/month (hosted)

Given Plus One's **unique quota + trial + accountability** combination:

| Suggested Tier | Price | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Starter | $5-8/mo | Match Trial Bot hosted pricing; basic quota modes |
| Pro | $12-15/mo | Multiple quota modes, full trial access features |
| Enterprise | $20-25/mo | Compete with Tier 3 custom bots, unlimited quotas |

**Key pricing insight**: No direct competitor offers controlled invite generation with quotas. Plus One creates a new category between "invite tracking" and "access management" - pricing should reflect this unique value.

**Roadie is for:**
- Live/physical events (concerts, festivals, conferences)
- Instant onboarding at venue (QR scan)
- Event producers wanting post-event community
- VIP/tiered access management at physical locations
- Converting IRL attendees to Discord community members

**Competitors are for:**
- Online event scheduling and RSVPs (Apollo, Sesh)
- Web3/token-gated communities (Guild.xyz)
- Monetizing Discord access (Whop)
- General meetup coordination (Event Organiser)

### Roadie Pricing Recommendation

The market shows:
- **Event calendar bots**: $5-7/month
- **Access gating platforms**: Free + transaction fees
- **Enterprise event platforms**: $200-500+/month

Given Roadie's **unique QR onboarding + physical event focus**:

| Suggested Tier | Price | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Starter | $9-15/mo | Above Apollo/Sesh (more specialized), per-event pricing possible |
| Pro | $29-49/mo | Multiple events, VIP tiers, analytics |
| Enterprise | $99-199/mo | Unlimited events, custom branding, API access |

**Alternative pricing models to consider:**
- **Per-event pricing**: $25-50 per event (common in event industry)
- **Attendee-based**: $0.10-0.50 per QR scan/onboard
- **Hybrid**: Base subscription + per-event fees

**Key pricing insight**: Roadie has no direct competitors. Event bots focus on online scheduling; access platforms focus on monetization or token-gating. QR-powered physical event onboarding is a new category. Price based on value to event producers (audience retention, zero staff overhead) rather than competing with calendar bots.
