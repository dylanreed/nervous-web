Roadie


Instant Onboarding - No more asking your customers or fans to manually search or type in your server address:  Simply have the attendees scan a QR code and they can instantly join your Discord server.

Automatic Role Assignment - Roadie can automatically assign a special role (e.g. Summer Concert Tour 2025, VIP, EventCon, Early Supporter) making your new members feel recognized and valued.

Capture Event Momentum - Capitalize on the excitement of an in-person event.  When a customer/attendee is most interested in your brand, you provide an immediate next step for them to take.

Exclusive Channels and Areas - Use the special role to grant access to VIP channels or areas.  This would be an opportunity for post-event Q&As with your Artists, band members, or company representatives.  Run event-specific promotions and giveaways.  This can change your server from a general chatroom into a premium club.

Extend the Lifespan and Value of Your Event - An event will typically last a few hours or days.  By onboarding your community into your Discord server through Roadie, you can keep the discussions, networking, and brand engagement going even after everyone has gone home.

Build Hype for Future Events - Your new community of past attendees is the perfect place to market your upcoming events to.  Since they have already attended an event, they are more likely to attend again.

Fully Automated Onboarding - Your event staff doesn’t need to manually add users or assign roles.  Roadie will handle that process, letting your team focus on the event.
