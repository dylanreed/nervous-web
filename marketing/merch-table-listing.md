# Merch Table

Connect your Discord community to your Shopify store. Merch Table lets you offer exclusive products to members based on their Discord roles — Server Boosters, Patreon supporters, or any custom role you create.

## Key Features

- **Role-based product access** — restrict products to specific Discord roles
- **Automatic sync** — customer tags update when roles change
- **Cart validation** — prevents unauthorized purchases at checkout
- **Simple linking** — members connect accounts with `/link_shopify`
- **Admin dashboard** — manage visibility rules and monitor linked accounts

Perfect for creators, gaming communities, and anyone who wants to reward their most engaged Discord members with exclusive merch.

## How It Works

1. Install Merch Table on your Shopify store
2. Connect your Discord server
3. Set up visibility rules (which roles can see which products)
4. Members link their accounts with `/link_shopify` in Discord
5. Linked members with the right roles can purchase exclusive products

## Use Cases

- **Server Boosters** — Exclusive merch for members who boost your server
- **Patreon Supporters** — Sync Patreon roles to unlock special products
- **VIP Members** — Reward your most active community members
- **Early Access** — Let specific roles purchase new drops first
- **Limited Editions** — Restrict rare items to long-time members
