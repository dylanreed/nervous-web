# Bouncer Bot

**Professional Discord Moderation for Communities That Mean Business**

Stop juggling spreadsheets and losing track of who did what. Bouncer Bot gives your mod team the tools they need with complete accountability built in.

## The Problem

Managing a growing Discord server is chaos:

- Mods forget why someone was warned three months ago
- Bulk role updates go wrong with no way to undo them
- Raiders slip through because you can't pre-ban by ID
- Discord's 28-day timeout limit isn't enough for serious cases
- No visibility into which mods are active or what rules get broken most

---

## The Solution

Bouncer Bot is a moderation powerhouse designed for servers that need more than basic tools.

### Flexible Discipline

**Timeouts** that work your way—30 minutes, 7 days, or indefinite. Go beyond Discord's 28-day limit when you need to.

**Quarantine** isolates problem members by removing all roles and assigning a quarantine role. When it's over, their original roles are automatically restored. No spreadsheets required.

**Warnings** link directly to your server rules. Track which rules get broken and how often.

### Complete History

Every action is logged. Every action can be searched. `/modhistory @user` shows you everything—warnings, timeouts, bans, the works—with pagination for long histories.

Made a mistake? `/reverse` undoes it and logs that too.

### Bulk Operations Without Fear

Need to add a role to everyone who joined after a certain date? `/bulkrole` handles it. Made an error? Rollback within 24 hours. Full operation history included.

### Raid Protection

`/preban` lets you ban known troublemakers by user ID before they ever join. `/watchlist` monitors suspicious members and alerts you when they leave.

### Actionable Reports

`/modreport` generates analytics:

- Actions by type
- Top moderators by activity
- Most moderated users
- Rule violation breakdown

Export to CSV for external analysis or share the embed in your staff channel.

- **Owner protected**: Server owners can never be moderated
- **Auto-expiry**: Timeouts and quarantines end on schedule
- **Audit-ready**: Every action logged with moderator, reason, and timestamp
